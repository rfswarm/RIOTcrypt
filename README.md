# RIOTcrypt

This git was created to support and promote the usage of strong cryptographic algorithms on RIOT OS.

## TweetNaCl: a crypto library in 100 tweets

TweetNaCl is the smallest readable implementation of the NaCl crypto library. The cryptographic primitives chosen for NaCl allow fast implementations on a large variety of architectures. TweetNaCl was designed for small code size and memory footprint and cannot provide optimal run-time performance but should be usable on low-power embedded devices.

**Building TweetNaCl on RIOT OS**

The TweetNaCl source code can be downloaded from the authors homepage http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to or can be found within this git repository. The latest version of RIOT OS is located on github https://github.com/RIOT-OS/.
