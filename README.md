## TweetNaCl: a crypto library in 100 tweets

TweetNaCl is the smallest readable implementation of the NaCl crypto library. The cryptographic primitives chosen for NaCl allow fast implementations on a large variety of architectures. TweetNaCl was designed for small code size and memory footprint and cannot provide optimal run-time performance but should be usable on low-power embedded devices.
